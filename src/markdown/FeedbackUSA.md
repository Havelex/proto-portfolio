The whole trip was an awesome experience.  
We had a wonderful host family, who really cared for us and took us on trips. We
visited a cave, a Civil War battlefield and went on a hike with a beautiful view
across Virginia. However, of all the things our host family took us with, my
favorite one was the baseball game. The vibe was awesome, and the match was
exciting till the end.

One of my absolute highlights was also attending high school. The students were
really nice, welcoming and interested in us. Also, the teachers were awesome and
included in their lessons, so that we felt like a part of everything.
Furthermore, the teachers were great at their job. My two favorite teachers were
the English teacher and the History teacher, but unfortunately, I do not
remember their names. If you want to read more about it, you are invited to do
so: ["Welcome to the Jungle..."](/explore/sections/Washington/posts/HighSchool)

Sightseeing with the class was also great, and I have a feeling that it brought
us closer to our teachers. At least I attempted to do a little bit of bonding.
I am not _the_ sightseeing guy, but I must say, there were some sights, such as
the Washington Memorial or the Capitol Library, which I actually did enjoy
visiting. My favorite excursion, however, was the National Air and Space Museum
in Washington. I have a thing for space.

Now, I know it was a language trip, but to be completely honest, after just two
weeks of being in the USA, there is no noticeable difference in my language
skills than from before. Yet, what actually did impact my English, at least my
writing skills, was the English lesson we had in high school. (More about it at
["Vocabulary"](/explore/sections/Language/posts/Vocabulary).)

One last thing I want to mention is, that in America, everything is bigger. The
cars are bigger, the roads are bigger and on average the people are bigger, too.
Or at least wider. But that was really something that shocked me, because I did
not think, that there would be so many obese people in Washington D.C. I thought
that social media was exaggerating.

Despite all this, I will definitely miss America, especially Virginia and my
host family and I cannot wait for them to come visit us in the summer. Until
then:

Goodbye, America!
