**Time** is one of those phenomena you don't notice unless it is against you. Time runs differently
in these trenches. Slowly, when battles are being fought, quickly during ceasefires, where we need to
resupply and prepare for the next couple of hours of bombardment and slaughter, but it always runs
against us. The moments that are cherishable pass in an instant, while all those dreadful ones feel like
eternities.  
That German scientist might have been right about time being relative. Although this here is
probably less of a physical principle and more something in the direction of psychological horror.
The worse the situation the longer it lasts. I have no idea how long I was sitting in that hole on
the battlefield yesterday, ducking in cover, hoping that no enemy soldier would spot me and counting
on the possibility of being spared by artillery shells. I heard one impact right by my side, but it
didn't explode. There I was waiting for nightfall in order to crawl out of cover and sneak back into
my trench. I was not the only one that night, as I suddenly found myself standing before a German
soldier. It was probably only three seconds, but it felt as if time was standing still right then.
Luckily, we both shared the same thought and therefore made it back to our trenches yesterday. Or
was it ereyesterday?  
I had quickly lost track of time. The first month or so I still counted the days, but eventually I
realized, that there was no point in it. All I remember is the first exchange of fire. Probably,
because it was paradox in the sense of having been over so fast, that it felt like a blink of an
eye. Thinking back, it was presumably not much shorter, than the battles are now, but I don't know.
I don't even know how long I've been here for, or for how long I am awake. Time just sort of
dissolved and became unmeasurable. At least it still flows forward, but besides that, I know nothing
but one thing:

**"I need more bullets."**
