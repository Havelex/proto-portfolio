### Lopum Isid

**The "Grimace"**.  
Some say it is an all powerful force, responsible for the existence and preservation of our
universe, others believe that it is a deity with infinite power and control. Whomever you may
believe, they have one thing in common. Their devoted worship for it. Not out of love, but out of
fear. No one knows where those believes have originated from or why, but evidently it has been
here since the most ancient times of humanity, as our first books mention it, and furthermore, there
are whole monoliths, older than all the books discovered, dedicated to the **Grimace**, but even
more venerable are the cave paintings and relics from most primitive times, that clearly depict some
sort of deity that can be connected to the **Grimace**.

Despite being the oldest religion known to man, it was not the only religion. There were countless
others, and although there have been countless holy wars scattered across time, they all lie in the
far past and there has been harmony between the religions ever since.  
That was, until the **Grimace** _blessed_ us all with the **"Gyatt"**. Or so the alphas always preach.
The **Gyatt**. A multidimensional relic, containing virtually infinite knowledge and history,
especially about the **Grimace** and its surrounding religion. It is so advanced that it has to be
made by some form of higher being or force, maybe extraterrestrial beings or even the **Grimace**
itself. Whatever may be the origin of the **Gyatt**, its integrity was recognized by everyone,
regardless of believes.

This is the kind evidence that every religion hopes for, to prove that they are the _true_ one and
that the other ones where all _wrong_. However, simply proving the other religions wrong wasn't
enough. Many people converted to **Skibidism**, as they deemed the **Gyatt** as sufficient proof that
this was the true religion. Nevertheless, there were yet countless others who would not give up
their believes so easily. Yet, it did not matter, as they were outnumbered and no one cared for
their religions and believes anymore. Worse, in each realm the **Skibidis** gained dominion, they
declared anything else than **Skibidism** illegal. This also included **Atheism**. And anyone who
would violate those laws, was hunted and exterminated. Henceforth, it was not long after the
spawning of the **Gyatt** that the whole world fell under **Skibidistic** control and became a
Theocracy.

And so it has been for eons. On top the **alphas**, _closest_ to the **Grimace** and reigning over
everything. Under their direct command follow the **betas**. They speak to the public and bring it
the words of the alphas. Additionally, they give orders to the next lower rank in the chain of
command, the **gammas**, who are there to propagate all directives and holy messages to the smaller
provinces, which are not significant enough to be worth to be visited by a **beta**.  
Moreover, they have additional responsibilities, such as executing the laws made by the **alphas**
and **betas**. This means that they have high positions in economics, law enforcement and military.
Henceforth, every CEO in a company, General on a base and Captain on a precinct is naturally a
**gamma**. This enables the **betas** and especially the **alphas** to easily control the middle and
lower class and surveil the population.  
The **deltas** compose the middle class, as they are the employees, soldiers and police officers,
who the **gammas** command.  
Last and certainly least in the eyes of society are the **omegas**. They are the lower class, and
although they are technically not in the chain of command, it has established itself, that
**omegas** are inferior to **deltas**.

On closer examination, this whole social structure is not so far off from the one present in the
days before the spawning of the **Gyatt**. However, the freedom the people once had is now gone.
Surely, there are some who do not mind about this at all. The **alphas**, **betas**, **gammas** and
probably even most of the **deltas** don't seem to care. Why would they? But the **omegas**, don't
have it as easy as the others do, not that they have any power to change anything and of course
there have been attempts. All unsuccessful.

The original **alphas** are to blame for why the **Skibidis** where able to gain total control so
quickly and without much (significant) resistance. Legend has it, that the **Gyatt** gave group of
people a tremendous power known as **"rizz"** and they became the first **alphas**. They were only a
hand full, but they had unspoken **rizz** so powerful, that no army in the world was able to pose a
real challenge to them, and they destroyed anyone who opposed them.
These days, the **alphas** have appointed people to do their dirty work. They are called
**"gooners"** and resemble somewhat of special force under the directives of the alphas.
Usually, these are either **betas** or **gammas**, who have been blessed with limited **rizz** by
the **alphas**, to keep everything in order. The **gooners** work from the shadows, but they are the
ones who are really responsible for protecting the **alpha's** laws and Theocracy, not the military
or police.  
The **gooners** are also the ones who will take care of anybody who fails to comply to the laws and
believes. Of course, smaller misconducts are being handled by the police, nevertheless, but say
someone where to mention their disbelief in **Grimace**, then the **gooners** would step in. If it
is your first offense, you will be _edged_ which is an ability most **"rizzlers** (, people
who are blessed with the power of **rizz**,) possess.  
It is a highly psychological technique where the **rizzler** enters the mind of their opponent and
is able to plant thoughts, memories, believes and other thought constructs. However, despite it
being a cognitive process, it can cause immense pain, both physical and psychological. If an
_edging_ session lasts too long or is repeated too often, it will leave scars both in the mind and
on the body.  
Most people stay away from trouble, after their first _edging_ session and some need to be reminded
a second or third time in order to obey. Unfortunately, some spirits are too strong to be broken by
_edging_ and if that is the case, the **gooners** make their name justice, because then, they will
_goon_ you.  
Apart from its users, no one knows how _gooning_ works. Why? Because if they _edge_ you
once you will survive. If they _edge_ you twice or thrice, you will probably be hurt and scarred for
life, but you will survive. But if they _goon_ you ... No one has ever returned from a _gooning_
session.
