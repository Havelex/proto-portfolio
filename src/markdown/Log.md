#### Darkness

Today I tried something out: Writing about a random concept in a poetic way and I liked it. Today's
subject: ["Darkness"](/explore/sections/Iterium%20Sapienta/posts/Darkness).  
I will probably repeat this activity tomorrow and overmorrow. Should I then still be as enthusiastic
about this as I am today, then I will consider writing a collection of likewise texts to include in
my Portfolio as final act.

Work time concluded ~ 30 min.

#### Purpose

Well that worked out well. Anyhow, I finally found the time and motivation to write the next entry
in my series.  
Today's subject: ["Purpose"](/explore/sections/Iterium%20Sapienta/posts/Purpose).  
While writing this piece, I have decided, that I want each entry to be about a different famous
fictional character talking about a concept, that fits their person. Furthermore, I have established
the pattern, to end the piece shall and with a quote of the character, as a hint, since their name
is never mentioned.

Work time concluded ~ 20 min.

#### Gravity

I am writing once again, and this time, I have fulfilled my intention of writing a piece every day,
so far. To be fare, not a great challenge if it's only day two of the streak. Anyhow.  
Today's subject: ["Gravity"](/explore/sections/Iterium%20Sapienta/posts/Gravity).  
So far, I am determined to keep my promise of writing every day, because my motivation has not left
me, yet. However, I have to say it can be challenging to find the right words to fit the character
and to set up the quote at the end.

Work time concluded ~ 15 min.

#### Death

The streak is still going, and I have to say, this is my favorite piece so far, together with
["Darkness"](/explore/sections/Iterium%20Sapienta/posts/Darkness).  
Today's subject: ["Death"](/explore/sections/Iterium%20Sapienta/posts/Death).
This is the only one featuring a non-fictional character. Honestly, I chose him not only, because he
is the protagonist of one of my favorite movies of all time, but also because the quote and topic
fitted him very well.

Work time concluded ~ 25 min.

### 17.12.2023

#### Time

So far, going as strong as my Duolingo streak and motivation is still strong.  
Today's subject: ["Time"](/explore/sections/Iterium%20Sapienta/posts/Time).  
Although the character is not real, it takes place in the very real French trenches of world war
two, and I must say, I believe the setting fits the topic very well. Until now, I did not believe,
that people would give my writings much thought when reading them, but after this one I think
differently.

Work time concluded ~ 60 min.

#### Elysium

Not my favorite work, but I am no coward, so it too deserves its place in my collection.
Today's subject: ["Elysium"](/explore/sections/Iterium%20Sapienta/posts/Elysium).  
For context, Elysium is comparable to heaven and the counterpart to hell, also called Hades, in
Greek mythology. Unfortunately, I personally believe, that I have not done the character justice,
which is a shame, as he is one of my favorite ones.

Work time concluded ~ 45 min.

### 20.12.2023

#### Love

Unfortunately, I could not manifest enough motivation to write one yesterday.  
Today's subject: ["Love"](/explore/sections/Iterium%20Sapienta/posts/Love).  
This is one of my favorite entries, as it has a note a satire in it. At first, the choice of
narrator might seem a bit confusing and not really fitting, but if read on and put the initial
skepticism aside, it becomes a very interesting monolog.

Work time concluded ~ 30 min.

#### Harmony

It has been a relatively long break, but my friends stopped reading the pieces I sent them and so my
motivation faded away. I don't blame them though, as we all have a lot to do, and they might not
have had time or had simply forgotten about it.  
Today's subject: ["Harmony"](/explore/sections/Iterium%20Sapienta/posts/Harmony).  
I am a big fan of the franchise today's character is from, and although the text didn't turn out to
be a masterpiece, I still take liking in it.

Work time concluded ~ 20 min.

### 18.01.2024

#### Change

Alright, I know I say this at almost every character, but this is one of my favorite fictional
personalities.  
Today's subject: ["Change"](/explore/sections/Iterium%20Sapienta/posts/Change).  
The characters background and philosophies are perfect for the concept of change. I will probably
write two more entries as I am slowly running out of ideas and ambition.

Work time concluded ~ 25 min.

### 12.02.2024

#### Life

I don't expect anyone to guess this character, but he is from a movie on a spaceship, featuring
Chris Pratt as the protagonist, and it's not "Guardians of the Galaxy".  
Today's subject: ["Life"](/explore/sections/Iterium%20Sapienta/posts/Life).  
Before I try to elaborate my thoughtful choice of topic and character, I'll just admit, that I chose
both, because I really like the quote and wanted to feature it in my work.

Work time concluded ~ 20 min.

### 03.03.2024

#### Freedom

This time, I chose the character first, not because of the quote, but because he is from my other
all-time favorite movie.  
Today's subject: ["Freedom"](/explore/sections/Iterium%20Sapienta/posts/Freedom).  
Admittedly, it was hard to find a quote, but in turn, writing the monolog was relatively easy.
In the end, I am very proud of the whole collection I have compiled, and I feel confident to
publish.

Work time concluded ~ 40 min.

### 29.03.2024

#### Nisi Veritas

Today, I read Jakob's final act, and I felt a little bit inferior. Probably, because all year long,
felt superior, that I had my final act figured out and was ahead with my work for the first time in
my life. However, after seeing what an astonishing idea Jakob had, I felt that I had to write more.  
Henceforth, I have created ["NisiVeritas"](/explore/sections/Lipom/posts/NisiVeritas).  
It is inspired by generation "Z" meme culture, but even so, if you replace all the jokes, you get a
well written text, nevertheless.

Work time concluded ~ 70 min.

#### Escape Room

After I gave **"Nisi Veritas"** to Jakob, so he can read, he gave me very very _constructive_
criticism. I took that criticism to heart and decided to create a third part and since I thought it
would be nice to include something interactive for the reader. So I made a little escape room
adventure, because why not?

Work time concluded ~ 420 min.

### Digitalization - Iterium Sapienta

#### 01.04.2024

I started to digitalize all entries of **Iterium Sapienta**. So far I have completed to copy
"Darkness", "Purpose" and "Gravity". Of course, I am also rewriting the texts and correct any
mistakes I found, so the versions online can be considered to be second drafts.

Work time concluded ~ 180 min.

#### 02.04.2024

Today I finished putting "Death", "Elysium" and "Time" online. I found so many stupid mistakes. This
is the reason why second drafts exist. (And spellchecking.)

Work time concluded ~ 180 min.

#### 03.04.2024

Last day, because I have finished digitalizing the rest of the entries. These being: "Change",
"Freedom", "Life", "Harmony" and "Love". All in all, it was a really productive day. I guess I just
found the right Spotify playlist to boost my focus.

Work time concluded ~ 200 min.
