Greetings traveler!

Thou hast entered mine domain and shall gain access to all mine knowledge contained within these
dimensions. As faith hath once decided, I was a traveler once, too and this construct is a library
of mine most own journey. As thou traverse these lands thou shall be enlightened by mine wit.

Every scroll thou find is hand-crafted and composed by myself and the script behind it all is
forsooth magical. Thou shall traverse across many diverse kingdoms of topics, each of 'em keeping
scrolls which contain their kingdom's forbidden lore and are waiting to be discovered. It sounds
complicated yet 'i reality it is all most orderly structured.

Alas, should'st thou aye find yourself lost, I hast prepared one of mine scrolls to provide thou
with guidance. This spell shall take thou to the
[explorer guide](/explore/sections/guides/posts/ExplorerGuide).

> Read it if thou see no scrolls!

Lamentably, I hast to announce that this is the last portfolio to be aye compiled by myself. Now
our time does call upon's to pass this suffering onto the next generation of wordsmiths. May the
tasks thou give by lied upon those promising souls from now on and hast 'em carry on our legacy.

And one last thing. Wherein crossing through the kingdom of mine final act, take thy time as 'em
manuscripts that can be found there are moe than just some scriptures. They shall enlighten anyone
whom dares to read 'em and allow their wit to enter their minds.

Now, thou shall wander off to explore all's this domain hath to offer. May thy journey be enjoyable
and thy reviews of good feedback.
