Greetings traveler!

You have entered my domain and shall gain access to all my knowledge contained within these
dimensions. As faith has once decided, I was a traveler once, too and this construct is a library of
my very own journey. As you traverse these lands you shall be enlightened by my wisdom.

Every scroll you find is hand-crafted and composed by myself and the script behind it all is truly
magical. You will traverse across many different kingdoms of topics, each of them keeping scrolls
which contain their kingdom's forbidden lore and are waiting to be discovered. It sounds complicated
but in reality it is all very orderly structured.

However, should you ever find yourself lost, I have prepared one of my scrolls to provide you with
guidance. This spell will take you to the
[Explorer Guide](/explore/sections/Guides/posts/ExplorerGuide).

And one last thing. When crossing through the kingdom of my final act, take your time as them
manuscripts that can be found there are more than just some scriptures. They shall enlighten anyone
who dares to read them and allow their wisdom to enter their minds.

Now, you shall wander off to explore everything this domain has to offer. May your journey be
enjoyable and your reviews of good feedback.
