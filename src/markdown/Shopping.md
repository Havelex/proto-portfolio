Washington D.C. is known for being the capital of the United States of America
and of course, for all the notorious sights located there, such as the
Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial or the Capitol. However, Washington is
not only a great city for conducting sightseeing, but also for shopping.

There are many points of interest for people who like window shopping, spending
money or are in need of a souvenir. For example, one of the most famous stores
when it comes to souvenirs and merchandise, is undoubtedly the Hard Rock Cafe.
Every third person collects them, but every first person appreciates a Hard Rock
sweater as a gift. Or, if one needs some old-fashioned gift shop gift, they may
seek out one of the many gift shop trucks, because other than NYC, Washington
D.C. has not as many gift shops, but instead at every main road a line of food
trucks and also trucks that sell souvenirs.  
However, if one wants to see something astonishing, then they should visit the
Carnegie Library. It is a beautiful old building, with the words "WASHINGTON
PVBLIC LIBRARY" engraved.

Yet this is just an illusion, since on entry, one will quickly notice that the
inside does not look like a library at all. It looks like an Apple Store. Which
probably explains the Apple logo on the building's front, but this is still
mind-blowing. They bought a public library and remodeled it into an Apple Store.
Capitalism at its finest.

Besides these exceptions, shopping is not that different, than in Austria. The
only noticeable difference is the sales tax, which is included in Austrian
prices, but not American. It is very annoying when forgetting, that the desired
item is more expensive than the price tag says.  
That, and the fact, that sales people seem much nicer and interested in helping
customers with their shopping, even though they do not get tipped for it. In
Austria such kindness is hardly found. At least in larger stores.

Another surprise is, that the gift shops of the sights actually offer more than
just a few coffee mugs and t-shirts. The capitol, for example, has really
beautiful, high quality playing cards and a nicely shaped flask for liquor, with
the presidential seal on. And in the gift shop of Mt. Vernon (George
Washington's Home) one is able to purchase a pretty wine stopper with the
Washington Griffin as motive.

In general, it can be said, that shopping in Washington D.C. has its appeal.
Even though the city is not known for being a shopping hot spot, one can stumble
across various stores with interesting items. However, do not underestimate the
gift shops either, as they might have something neat to bring home. And of
course, keep an eye on the price, since the sales tax is, as mentioned before,
**not** included.
