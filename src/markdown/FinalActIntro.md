Alas, thou hast found mine final act. It is the perfect example of mine most own indecisiveness.
To elaborate, mine final act consists of three sub acts:

- **Iterium Sapienta**  
  A collection of wit gathered by a lone traveler, whom had visited countless verses and had spoken
  to the most wise entities to hast aye existed.

- **Nisi Veritas**  
  The first chapter of a brain rot fan fiction, thoughtfully composed with care.

- **Escape the Unescapable**  
  A 'scape room adventure filled with various challenges all of outrageous difficulty. Hast fun, and
  try not to despair.
