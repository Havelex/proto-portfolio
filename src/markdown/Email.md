Dear Leonard,

I hope this email finds you well.  
I have arrived safe and sound in Washington D.C. and have now been living for
four days with my lovely host family. They are amazing and really caring. The
father, Chris is his name, has lived in Graz, too, for a while and is a funny
guy. Anna is the mother's name, and she's very sweet and caring. We never had to
eat fast food, because she would cook every day and prepare lunch for us when we
went to school. Their children, Greta and Smith (yes that is his first name) are
also very nice and Greta is cracked at Smash. It is unbelievable.  
Speaking of Smash, they have almost every Nintendo console you can imagine in
their basement gaming cave. I played some Mario 64 and together with Jakob I
started replaying Donkey Kong. It is very nostalgic.

Since, I briefly mentioned food before, I have to say we are pretty lucky,
because we've heard from our peers, that they often eat fast food and that some
of the parents rarely or never cook by themselves. Often they would throw frozen
food into the oven or microwave and claim that they had cooked dinner. We are so
glad, that Anna is a great cook and that she actually makes the food herself
from fresh ingredients.

Another thing I am really thankful for, is that they really care about us seeing
and experiencing things.  
For example, today Chris took us to the battlefield of the first battle of the
American Civil War. It was fascinating. On Friday he also took us to
Microcenter, which is like Mediamarkt, but so much better. I believe he enjoys
taking us to places and also the car rides themselves, as we always have a lot
of fun exchanging music and experiences. You must know, that Chris is a fan of
Austrian and German 90s/00s pop music.

In the evening we are going to watch a baseball game, live. You know that I am a
baseball fan, so you might imagine how excited I am about this. I will write to
you about how it was, as soon as we get back home. And then, Jakob and I will
probably hustle Donkey Kong again.  
What a life.

Best wishes

Max

PS: When I'm back in Graz, we must do something together again, for old times'
sake.
