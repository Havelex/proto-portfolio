Whilst exploring New York City in my free time, I stumbled across a little
bookshop, which was also a cozy little coffee shop. It does not seem that
special, but when you finally spot the small staircase leading to an area
both the coffee shop, you'll find a large variety of books and also multiple
seating opportunities.

It was there were I spotted a book named "Seven Brief Lessons on Physics" which
piqued my interest. So I sat down and started reading and when it was time to go,
I liked the book so much, that I decided to purchase it.

The next day, I again journeyed to the same bookstore, because I was looking for
a book for Ms. Walzl, and I found an interesting one about Chances and how to
use them in life. I started reading it, so I could evaluate whether it would be
interesting for Ms. Walzl or not. I liked it almost more than the book I bought,
and so I grabbed myself a cup of Camille tea from the coffee shop downstairs
and continued reading.  
In the end I didn't buy the book, which I really regret now.

Anyway, the bookshop was really nice designed and the conveniently fused with
the coffee shop. I haven't found anything like it in Austria, but I am also not
someone who reads a lot of books, so I probably didn't look hard enough.  
This bookshop was at the pier and I also went inside one downtown, which wasn't
nearly as nice as the one I bought my book at.  
Henceforth, I believe that the one at the pier is an exception.

The bookshop in question is by the way called "McNally Jackson Books Seaport"
and is located in the Seaport district of New York City.

Now to the book itself (the one I ended up buying), it was the first book I've
actually enjoyed reading for a long time. However, I cannot comment on the
highlight of the book, as it is not a novel and therefor its style is more flat
as there is no actual story, so there is no need for a "highlight".  
Yet, had I choose a part of the book I like in particular, I would say the
style. It reminds me of Bill Bryson's columns (without an underlying tone of
irony), as the book itself is also structured in relatively short chapters which
are written anecdotally, with the twist, that it is of course based on facts,
but personalized with some of the author's experiences.

Consequently, I can really recommend the book for anyone interested in physics,
but tired of all the strictly "educational" text books. Additionally, the book
has no prerequisites regarding knowledge on physics and can henceforth be read
by anyone who enjoys styles like Bill Bryson's.

Furthermore, should you ever find yourself in Manhattan, with a little bit of
time to spare, I truly advice you to seek out McNally Jackson Books Seaport,
have a cup of tea or coffee and grab yourself something to read.
