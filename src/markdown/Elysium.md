**Elysium** is the place where our loved ones wait for us after death. A paradise, home to the
blessed in their afterlife. Elysium is the counterpart to hades, and although I yearn for Elysium to
reunite with someone very deer to me, I doubt that I will reach it ever again. For that, the weight
of the sins I carry is too heavy to let me rise up to this heavenly realm. They will pull me down to
the underworld.  
Despite this, I could find closure, as I have done the right thing in life and old friends are going
to be waiting for me when arriving in hell. Whilst I am not satisfied with every choice I have made
in the past, I know that what is done cannot be undone and yet, sometimes I wonder if there is an
Elysium in the realm of the living. A place where even warriors like me can find happiness. I might
be immortal, but I am not invincible.  
One day in my eternal life, the time will have come where I die and then not even I may evade
judgement. So in the end, even if I were to find this Elysium of the living, it would be temporary
after all.  
And yet, I would sacrifice everything to hold her again, even if it were to last only mere moments.
Elysium or not, my time has yet to come, and I am neither afraid of death, not the judgement that
follows after. Yet, I won't go without a fight.

_**"Death can have me when it earns me!"**_
