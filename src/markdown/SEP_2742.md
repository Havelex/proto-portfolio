#### Protocol Entry

You have successfully passed initial authorization and therefor may now proceed with the next step.

If the Super Emergency Protocol is in place it probably means, that you are trapped in the
hibernation room. Since in such a case the power is allocated to vital systems and hibernation only,
you must find a way to revert the power to the doors to be able to reach other rooms. In order to
redirect the power from inside the hibernation room, you need to unscrew the panel on the Captain's
hibernation pod to reach the electronic behind.

After unscrewing the bolts of the Captains you are met with a circuit. There is only enough power to
power two things at once. Life support must be running at all times, or you die. This means you need
to revert the power from the hibernation pods to the doors.
