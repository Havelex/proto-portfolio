Alas, thou hast found mine final act. It is the perfect example of mine most own indecisiveness.
To elaborate, mine final act consists of three sub acts:

- [**Iterium Sapienta**](</explore/sections/Iterium Sapienta/posts/Abstract>)  
  A collection of wit gathered by a lone traveler, whom had visited countless verses and had spoken
  to the most wise entities to hast aye existed. Each entry is about a different concept, talked
  about by a different person.

- [**Nisi Veritas**](/explore/sections/Lipom/posts/NisiVeritas)  
  The first chapter of a brain rot fan fiction, thoughtfully composed with care.

- [**Escape the Unescapable**](</explore/sections/Escape Room/posts/ETU>)  
  A 'scape room adventure filled with various challenges all of outrageous difficulty. Hast fun, and
  try not to despair.
