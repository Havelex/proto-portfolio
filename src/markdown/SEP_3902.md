#### Protocol Entry

Alright, eye exam passed. Running diagnostics program right now. ... ... ...

Damn. The ship is pretty damaged, I assume. Of course, I don't know for sure, as this is just a
written protocol, but I assume that if you read this entry, that your ship is pretty badly damaged.
You can just pretend that this is happening live in real time if it makes you feel better.

Anyway, since you ship is running on auxiliary power, the results might be a bit obfuscated.
Fortunately, you did that eye test, so it should be no challenge for you make out whatever the
program gives you.
