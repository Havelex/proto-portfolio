**Purpose** is a concept. The concept of an obligation towards something and ultimately towards
oneself. An obligation which describes the pursuit of a certain goal and eventually, when this goal
is reached, one's purpose vanishes and consequently their drive to exist fades away.  
Ironically, beings that are unaware of their purpose do not seem to lack a will to exist,
nevertheless. And what about a being that is caught in an illusion of possessing a purpose? Since
they believe in them having a purpose, they should be driven to live.  
So really, the belief of having a purpose is as powerful as missing a purpose while being unaware of
it, as well as knowingly being purposeful. However, as soon as a purpose is fulfilled and thereby
seized to exist, while the being in context is in realization of it, the being in question looses
their desire to exist. It all makes sense now.  
Looking back, I did possess no true purpose and yet, I had this belief of being purposeful somehow.
Then, when I received this power from them, I truly became purposeful, however at that point of
time, I was fully unaware of it. Nevertheless, the time came for me to discover my purpose and
pursue my obligation. It gave me will, but now everyone and everything is dead. Even those who have
been believed to be eternal, immortal and everlasting. I have fetched their souls eons ago. Now
there are no more souls to fetch. Except...  
How ironic, but apparently it is the last thing to do anyway. Somewhere deep down I have always
known that this day would come, when I would speak those words to myself. Even after all this time,
my tool has remained as reliable and shiny as on the day I received it. As if it had known, that its
master would need a conveniently accessible mirrored surface to talk to themselves.  
Now!

_**"Your time has come!"**_
