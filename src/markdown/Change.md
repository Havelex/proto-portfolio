**Change** is everywhere and can happen anywhere, anytime. It may occur slowly over time, like the
growth of a city or a kingdom, or the graduate shift of the night sky over eons. However, change is
noticed strongest when happening suddenly in the blink of an eye. The death of a king, a new regime
taking over, or civil war breaking out all of a sudden, or maybe all the aforementioned
simultaneously. I have seen it all.  
Yet, change may not be unfortunate per default, as it might bring improvements. Better conditions
for the people, peace, freedom, stability. But the most interesting kind of change is the change
within people themselves. Often they change for the worse and become greedy, hungry for power,
broken or simply straight up evil. And again this might happen slowly through a habit, the influence
of environment or other subtle, but frequent factors, or a person changes instantly, because of
experiencing a trauma, an accident, an incident, having met someone or being the witness to
something horrible.  
Sometimes, good people turn evil, sometimes it is the other way around and if so, they shall be
given to show regret and chasing redemption for the things they have done by doing good for the
world and its people.  
If one is judged souly on their past I have to ask:

_**"What is better? To be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?"**_
