**Freedom** is a funny word. It is constantly being used and misused by deluded people who talk
about countries, wars, oppression and freedom, while they are shackled to the ground by their own
social believes society has laid upon them. They are being poisoned by their false idols and images
and have fallen to become slaves of capitalism. Everyone is constantly talking about how they live
in the freest country in the world, whilst working nine to five, just to be able to afford the
newest gadgets advertised in their shiny magazines.  
An old friend of mine once said: "The things you own end up owning you.", and I couldn't agree more.
Lucky for him, he doesn't own anything anymore. I suppose that makes him the freest of us all.  
Most people realize relatively quickly, that they are fucking nobodies, and they just accept it.
What they don't realize is, that they have a chance. An opportunity, no somebody has. In short: No
one cares. Nobody gives a single fuck about what you do. Even further, most won't even register that
you exist. It can be a powerful gift if misused correctly, but most people will probably never
realize this.  
After all.

_**"It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything."**_
