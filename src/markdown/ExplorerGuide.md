## Structure

The portfolio is structured 'i sections, for example, there is a section for mine final act named
'Final Act'. Inside every section are the contents like items, entries, articles etc. Every one
of those items includes a chance for thou to give feedback. (Pls no **NSFW**.)

## Navigation

As long as thou are at **'/explore'** or below, thou may access the sidebar (_on the left-hand
side_) in order to fast travel to every section and every piece of content. Also, use the search bar
in the side to traverse intelligently between locations, which thou might be especially interested
in.

##### **Note:**

> The sidebar is by default closed. Toggle it by striking the **triangle** on the left-hand-side.

##### **Important:**

> If the scrolls are hidden. Thou must cast `<F5>` to conjure them.
