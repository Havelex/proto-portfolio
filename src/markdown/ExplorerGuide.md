Greetings traveler!

Welcome to my domain containing my English portfolio of 2023/24. Feel free to
explore all parts and corners of these lands. I hope you enjoy your journey. For help, refer to the
**Explorer Guide**.

## Structure

The portfolio is structured in sections, for example, there is a section for our trip to America
named 'America'. Inside every section are the contents like items, entries, articles etc. Every one
of those items includes a chance for you to give feedback. (pls no **NSFW**)

## Navigation

Besides the navbar, as long as you are at **'/explore'** or below, you may access the sidebar of
fast travel (_on the left-hand side_) to travel to every section and every piece of content. Also, use the
search bar in the navbar to traverse intelligently between general locations or the one in the
sidebar to reach items of content, which you might be looking for in particular.

> Note
> The sidebar is by default closed. Toggle it by clicking the **triangle** on the left-hand-side.
