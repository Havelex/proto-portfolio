### THEY ARE IN THE GOD-DAMN TREES!!!

Second day in New York City. We had already been exploring a lot and in the
evening, we were going to see Hamilton on the Broad Way. It was a musical, but
not in the classical style, most of the songs were rap songs, which personally,
I thought was amazing. Honestly, the whole piece was amazing and even Jakob
seemed to like it, though he was not great in admitting it.

After the musical, the whole group, lead by the teachers, tried to find a place
to eat, that would accommodate us, since we were a large group. Unfortunately,
we were unsuccessful, as not only was there anyone who was willing to serve a
group as large as ours, but also were we in a disagreement about what food to
eat. Consequently, our teachers allowed us to split up into groups and find
something to eat by ourselves. So long we would be ready in the hostel's lobby
at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

Despite being a smaller group, our food preferences at the time differed
anyway. Some wanted kebab whilst Felix longed for Hard Rock food, which the rest
of us were neither willing to pay for, nor wait in the especially long queue.  
Finally, we decided to go to a pizza place, where some of the group had already
been prior. The food was alright, although you would have noticed right away,
that it was New Yorker pizza, as it was especially greasy.

Eventually, we decided to make our way back to the hostel. Of course, the bright
idea was to walk through the Central Park. Mind, it was 12 a.m. and darkish (it
never really gets dark in NYC), however, there were 7 of us, and we felt
confident enough to take that risk.  
It was nice, seeing the city at night, but it felt like dawn 5 a.m. so were not
tired at all.  
The park was surprisingly empty, except for a few fellas and of course:
Raccoons!  
We spotted one in the grass, and he seemed surprised as he T-posed at us.
Proceeding, we went raccoon hunting and sought to find more of them little
rascals. Some minutes later, we came across another one, that quickly climbed up
a tree, after he noticed us. When following it with our eyes, we discovered
another two, sitting on the tree and shining their reflective eyes at us.  
They might as well had mastered guerilla warfare, so after a taking enough
pictures, we decided not to find out and be on our way.

We came across a water fountain, where we took turns drinking and for some
reasons take snapshots, while drinking. The water tasted weird, by the way.  
Finally, at 1 a.m. the group found their way home safe and sound. And thus
another exciting day in America went to an end. Or more accurately, a new
exciting day begun.
