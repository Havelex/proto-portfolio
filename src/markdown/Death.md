**Death** is what comes after life and yet somehow it is a part of life after all. Nevertheless,
despite death being inevitable, it is rare, that people accept it as something natural. Obviously,
if death is impending, one might feel uneasy, but when thinking about it, it makes more sense not to
worry about something as certain as death. Understandable, however, is the grief from loosing a dear
one to a premature death. It seems unfair, but death knows no fairness, it does not know anything,
it just strikes when the time has come. Sometimes, people are the death of other people. It is a
relatively common occurrence, especially in times like these.  
Soldiers killing other soldiers, not out of free will, but because they have to. On the battlefield
it is kill or be killed. Either you become death, or somebody else will in your place, and they
might not be on your side.  
I am not a soldier and yet, when I saw what we have created I felt like an army. From what I have
heard, being a solder in an army during times of war does not forth emotions of liveliness, and
additionally having to take a live, certainly will do no good either. At least not for the killer
and probably also not for the dead.  
I am about to be responsible for the death of tens of thousands of people. Most of them civilians.
Killed in an instant by my creation. Something so powerful is destined to change the world. One
_death_ taking so many lives, accompanied by unthinkable destruction. All from a single device. A
little bit more and the power to destroy whole countries becomes reality. The power to destroy a
world.  
So it is true then.
