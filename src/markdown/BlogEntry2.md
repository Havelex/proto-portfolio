### The closer the batter!

Saturday is baseball day. It's probably not, but we did attend a baseball game.
While our peers went to some lame high school baseball game, we went to a big
one. Nationals vs Astros. We of course rooted for the Nationals.  
They quickly took the lead and were few points ahead in the third inning.  
However, that did not last long as the Astros caught up quickly and in the sixth
inning it did not look so good anymore for the Nationals.  
Nevertheless, in the ninth and last inning, both teams were at a tie and the
Nationals were to pitch. They managed to throw three outs, before the other
teams could score a point.  
When they were batting they only needed one point to score. Because it was a
tiebreaker inning, they started with one runner on the second base, just as the
Astros have in their turn before.

The mood was awesome, and the crowd was hyped.
Generally, the vibe at this game was more like a festival. People would come and
go and come again with food in their hands. It was a nice alternative to being
at an Austrian soccer game.

Anyway, the Nationals' batter actually managed to almost hit a home run, but
despite not passing over the wall, it was enough for them to score the winning
point and turn the game around in their favor.

This certainly was the best game of any kind of sport, which I have watched
live, and you can imagine how hyped our host family was, after seeing their
favorite team win in such an epic way.
