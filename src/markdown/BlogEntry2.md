### The closer the batter!

Saturday is baseball day. It's probably not, but we did attend a baseball game.
While our peers went to some lame high school baseball game, we went to a big
one. Nationals vs Astros. We of course rooted for the Nationals.  
They quickly took the lead and were few points ahead in the third inning.  
However, that did not last long as the Astros caught up quickly and in the sixth
inning it did not look so good anymore for the Nationals.  
Nevertheless, in the ninth and last inning, both teams were at a tie and the
Nationals were to pitch. They managed to throw three outs, before the other
teams could score a point.  
When they were batting they only needed one point to score. They had two outs
already and 2 strikes on the current batter.
