#### Protocol Entry

If you read this, you must have had success with redirecting the power to the doors and are now
standing in the main corridor. Now you need to get to the bridge in order to run a full diagnose of
the ship. Shouldn't be too hard to find, since providing the doors with power also made the lights
go back on.

#### Protocol Notes

Should you not remember the ship's layout anymore due to some sort of amnesia, just remember that
there is a glow-in-the-dark floor plan. The stained-glass in front of it might make it a little bit difficult to
read, but you should manage.

If only you remembered the room numbers.
