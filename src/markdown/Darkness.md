Darkness is the absence of light. Henceforth, darkness requires light for its very existence. But
this. This is not Darkness, as there has never been light. The lack of contrast results in the
missing concept. It is neither _light_ nor _darkness_, yet it is something.  
The void? Unfortunately, a void is nothing other but the absence of something, or anything, ... or
everything. Neither is it nothing, for there has to be **not** anything there, for there to be
nothing.  
Then what is something that is neither anything nor nothing?. Is it even something? Presumably not.
Consequently, a new concept is required to describe a contrastless abstract. But then it seems, that
I have made an error in my assumption about concepts, as it now appears as if concepts are not
required to be the result of a contrast. However, this leads to my definition of a concept being
inconsistent. Indubitably, I could distinguish between concepts and contrastless concepts.
