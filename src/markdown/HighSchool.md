### ...we've got fun and games!

Ah, American high school. A vast ecosystem, filled with various entities, who
all yearn for education.

But first, the students have to get there, and they do so, by riding yellow
school buses. When they arrive at the school, they wait for all other school
buses, in order to release all the students at once. Mind that there is a fleet
of school buses and when all the students hurry inside, it looks as if an army
was invading.

Once inside, the hallways are cramped, as people make their way to their
classes. It all is very lively. The hallways are decorated, the school's
trophies are being proudly displayed and students wear a smile on their face.
The whole atmosphere is very friendly and happy. Not only in the hallways
between classes, but also during the lessons themselves. The students seem to
like being in class and actively participating and their relationships with
their teachers seem genuinely friendly and progressive.

In contrast, Austrian high schools have a much darker, thicker and sadder
atmosphere. The students there seem all stressed, depressed and overworked.
However, the hallways are not as cramped between classes, because different to
American high schools, where the teachers have dedicated classrooms and the
students must wander around, in Austria it is reversed, and the students have
their own classrooms, while teachers must move. Only exceptions are teachers
whose subject requires special rooms, like chemistry teachers. So instead of the
teachers, it is the students who decorate the classrooms, which bares both
positive and negative results.

Another difference to American high schools, is that the lessons are much
shorter. Only fifty minutes instead of ninety minutes. Some say it is better,
when there are fewer subjects a day, which then can get done much more, others
believe, that long lessons about one subject might overload the students'
brains, although why then should many different subjects be any better.  
Furthermore, relationships between students and teachers vary. Whereas some
teachers see students as equals and at least try to listen to them (mostly
younger teachers), some teachers think they are smarter, better and always
right, who hardly listen to what students say, because they believe they know
best (mostly older teachers). This leads to students stop respecting teachers
and caring about their lessons, as they are not respected either, whilst the
teachers who understand how the students feel, try to balance it out. It did not
appear as if American high schools had this problem. There the majority of
teachers listens to their students and encourage or help them, when they are
struggling.

Additionally, teachers seem to genuinely put more thought into their lessons,
than most of the Austrian teachers, because there was this one English class
where the teacher was giving the students particularly creative writing prompts,
and he also explained, why they were doing these tasks. At the end of the
lesson, as usual, there would be dedicated time for the whole class to read,
where every student may pick a book they like.  
Yet, a better example for creative and memorable lessons is presented by this
one history lesson, where for the complete ninety-minute period, the whole
class, including the exchange students, were having a round table debate about
the Cold War, where the students slipped into the roles of various world
leaders. Every one seemed to have fun, but also very prepared and knowledgeable
about their particular topic. The exchange students did well to, regarding that
they had not prepared. In short, the students have probably learned and more
importantly, remembered about the international relations during the Could War,
than they would have from a "normal" (Austrian) history lesson.  
You won't find something like this in an Austrian high school.

Despite the American education system's poor reputation, some of their methods
might not be that bad, and maybe it is time for Austrian schools, and many
others, to realize that and try to educate themselves about possibly
constructive change, for once. (Except for the daily pledging in the morning.
It would probably not go well in Austria.)
