**Gravity** is an enigma. It acts as if it were a force, though it is not, while in a way it is.
Maybe gravity is some sort of force-, curveture-duality. However, the more interesting fact about
gravity is its anomaly of being the weakest of all forces in the universe, whilst creating and
maintaining singularities and extremes, scaled to such an extent, that no phenomenon driven by any
of the other forces is even remotely comparable to this.  
And yet, a relatively weak electromagnetic field, weaker than the little effort it takes to nullify
the force generated by two identical instances of said electromagnetic field, oriented oppositely,
is required to counter the gravity of a planet. In simpler terms: A small magnet is enough to pick up a piece of ferromagnetic metal from a planet
like earth. Nevertheless, when gravity becomes strong enough, nothing escapes the immense force it
exercises.
Not even light.  
In the end, however, gravity is nothing else but the energy which pulls everything towards another,
on a large scale. It is the counter to empty space, which pushes everything away creating more empty
space, until the void dominates. Gravity, in the contrary, keeps things together.
