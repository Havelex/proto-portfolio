**Love** is fascinating, as it occurs in many forms. Platonic love can be described, so long I
trust my observations, the phenomenon where one is liked immensely by another one, without any sexual
feelings or desires for the opposite of the affected one. Romantic love, on the other hand, is
identified by those very desires. Indisputably, passion is nothing but another form love may take
on.  
I have witnessed countless instances of love, among them, the first ones. For example, the first time
someone loved platonically, I was there to witness it. He was full of love, when he created them,
maybe he liked them for their very nature, or simply because they reminded him of himself. Either
way, what do I care, as long as they are being loved.  
Speaking of which, if I am recalling my memories correctly, it was those very creations of his who
felt had felt love for the very first time in a romantic sense. I have to admit, the way they show
this kind of love to another is somewhat questionable in my opinion, but who am I to judge?  
In the case of passion however, I am unsure whether it was him or me who was passionate about
something, but I do know what happens if one is careless. Passion turns into obsession, obsession
engenders blindness, blindness breeds darkness, darkness, begets madness, madness sires suffering.  
Despite everything, I do not blame him for my banishment, as it was my fault alone for my vision to
have tarnished and myself refusing all help that was offered to me. In my eternal redemption, I have
accepted my fate and forgave him eons ago.  
Besides, someone has to run this place down here anyway. In reality, the old man did me a favor.
Everything here is terrible, I love it. After all:
