I have been very undecided about my final act, as one might notice. However, it was not always like
this. When I initiated this project, I was very confident about my choice at first, which was to
write a poesy collection where different characters would talk about different concepts for about a
page each. I named it `Iterium Sapienta`. But then, after the feedback from my friends had stopped
coming in, my motivation tarnished, and I began to wrap my final act up. Despite this I was still
feeling relatively satisfied and concluded my final act done.  
That was until I heard of Jakob's final act. HE MADE A FUCKING TEXT BASED ADVENTURE!!! His idea was
incredible and the scale of his final act ginormous.  
Effectively, this ignited the flame of ambition inside of me, once again. I was motivated to excel
myself, and thus I have manifested `Nisi Veritas`. A literary masterpiece inspired by the culture of
generation 'Z'.  
Nonetheless, my satisfaction lasted only mere moments, as I have requested Jakob himself to evaluate
my manuscript of madness. Needless to say, I did not live up to his expectation and got absolutely
mogged by him. Still, I have included `Nisi Veritas` in my portfolio as only cowards would cover up
their defeats.  
Broken but also motivated by my failure the fire inside me burned as hot and bright as a thousand
stars. This time I would create something interactive, like Jakob did, which bread the idea of the
escape room. Whilst there is not as much writing as in the other parts, it has been just as much
effort if not more. I am thankful to have a friend like Jakob.

Alas, peace.

In general, I enjoyed making every single one of the three parts of my final act, but I have to
admit that my favorite part is still `Iterum Sapienta`, even after everything that was. However, I
am glad that I also did the other parts. `Nisi Veritas` was very enjoyable to compile, as I have
never written such a long concatenated text before. It was nice to really work the story out,
without a limit, and I am thinking of expanding the storyline in the future, as it honestly serves
as a perfect introduction for a book or a tale.

`Iterum Sapienta` was probably the reason, why my browser history is nothing but
[Thesaurus.com](thesaurus.com), which is like a dictionary for synonyms. Ironically, they also host
a dictionary for all those words, which is creatively called ["Dictionary.com"](dictionary.com).
My vocabulary drastically expanded because of this. Here are my three favorite words that I have
added to my vocabulary:

- venerable
  > commanding respect because of great age or impressive dignity (dictionary.com)
- ereyesterday
  > the day before yesterday
- overmorrow
  > the day after tomorrow

I have to admit, that both `ereyesterday` and `overmorrow` I did not learn through Thesaurus, but I
listed them nevertheless, as they are my favorite words.

Admittedly speaking, I have to say, that the escape room probably was the one least beneficial for
improving my English. Nevertheless, I hope you enjoy it very much, as I have put as much effort in
it as into the other parts. And yes, the riddles are pretty hard, so don't restrain yourself from
emailing me any questions and I will give you some hints.

Depending on the person you are, I can recommend all three tasks to you, as I think every single one
of them is unique in their own way, yet quite enjoyable and valuable to do.  
A task like `Iterium Sapienta` is perfect to do just before bedtime, in order to maybe recover from
a day behind the screen, or just a simple (hard) day of work. I personally have written every single
one of those entries by hand, before then digitalizing them in a single day, and I must say, it was
beautiful, there is no other way to express my feelings about it.  
Additionally, `Nisi Veritas` is the perfect task to practice extended story writing. Every D&D (dungeon and
dragons) player would benefit from it (@Felix), but it is also very rewarding to just read through
your finished piece of art and admire what you have created.  
Last but certainly not least, is the escape room. Yes, there is not as much writing as in the other
once, but you still have to come up with a connected story for each room or riddle, and it should be
nice to read, nonetheless, so there is still a certain skill of English required, in order to
complete this task, whilst having produced an acceptable product.

In the end, I really liked the whole process of compiling my final act and letting my creativity all
freedom. As a result, I felt myself really grow as a writer and I honestly hope, that you had fun
reading and riddling through it.

Thank you for reading my **final act**!
