**Life** is hard to define and even harder to live. It can mean multiple things. What does it mean
to be alive? Simply breathing? But bacteria don't breathe. Reproduction might be the defining
criteria, except viruses reproduce, yet they are not considered living beings. Arguably, that is
more of a human opinion, than a fact. Still, natural reproduction of unlive objects can be observed
in the universe. Stars, for example, die, scatter matter across space, which eventually forms
nebulas, which in turn birth new stars that die again, scattering matter once more and continuing
the cycle. Nevertheless, I believe it can be objectively stated as a fact that stars are not living
things, despite the occasions where the "life of a star" is being mentioned.  
Henceforth, we need another way to define life. Maybe operating metabolism, although stars do that
too, by fusing hydrogen into helium and so on until reaching iron. Bummer, because viruses don't do
that. Perchance, a combination of all of the above? Probably.  
Ultimately, I believe life is more about being alive and living. In the metaphorical sense of
course. Consequently, life is about more than metabolism, reproduction and breathing. It also is
about more than work or problems or other man made responsibilities, and it is definitely not about
breaking your head over those man made concepts of responsibility.  
Take a break from what you can't control.
