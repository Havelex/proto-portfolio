I must admit, that I don't believe that the language trip actually impacted my
English skills. However, it certainly had a cultural impact on my peers and me,
and I definitely value it highly, as I have learned a lot of other valuable
things, by interacting with the locals there.

Although, there is one thing that did leave an impression on my use of the
English language. That one thing was the one English lesson I had in high
school. Since we were only taught English by people who are neither native
speakers nor are they from a native speaking country, being in a lesson taught
by a native speaker who had also studied to teach English was quite an
experience.  
We were tasked to write some texts as we participated in his class and the
teacher gave us great feedback on those texts. He pointed out various DOs and
DON'Ts when writing text, so they would seem more natural and closer to native
English.

Some of those things he said, that stuck with me are:

- Refrain from using phrases like "First of all", "Secondly", "Finally" to
  initiate your paragraphs.
- Do not use "In conclusion" or "To conclude" etc. when writing a conclusion.
- If the style allows it, do not write something like "In the report, written
  by ... published in ... on the ..." write something that transitions nicely and
  directly into the text _you_ are writing.

I wish I could have one more English lesson with him. He seems to have a lot of
fun teaching his students, even though he does not act like it, I believe he
really cares about every single one of them, because he gave personal feedback to
all of them on their texts and homework.  
Kind of like Ms. Neumeister does.
