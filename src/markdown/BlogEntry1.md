### _Knock knock!_ Who's there? It's the Austrians!

Today was our first day in school and it was certainly interesting. First we got
picked up by one of them yellow school buses. There are dedicated pickup points
for all children in a certain area. We waited for the bus with four or five
other kids that would go to Centerville High. On its way, the bus picked up more
students from other areas. Nico was one of them. When finally arriving at the
high school, there was an armada of school buses waiting in front of the school.
They wait together for every bus to arrive, before letting us exit.

When entering the school, we would stick closely to Greta, as there were
unbelievably many students and it was easy to get lost. We crossed paths with
some of our peers as we made our way to our first class, which was
jazz band. We didn't have anything to do and were just sitting there and
listening, but that was alright, since they were playing really well.

Next we had German. It was mediocre, and we expected a German teacher to be more
qualified when teaching high school level German, even if it's their second
language. However, we met some nice people, who were really interested in us, so
it was somewhat bearable.  
In German class we also had lunch break. We talked a lot with the students, and
they were amazed by our culture and its differences to theirs.

Afterward we went to Greta's home class, I believe it was called. I think it's
where students can get some work done, so they won't have to do it at home. We
also worked on our stuff, but also chatted with other students, whose interest
we seem to have piqued. I hope we didn't distract them too much.

The last class of the day was English, where the teacher actually wanted us to
participate, which was great. We got to write some texts and got really great
feedback, and I frankly like his teaching methods. Turns out, we were learning
English all wrong the whole time. He pointed out some things we should avoid
using in our text, so they would appear more native and natural.  
When we confronted our teachers about this they said that we were learning CAE
English, which is different, but I believe that was just an excuse, because they
were a little bit ashamed.  
It's alright, we all make mistakes sometimes.

After English was over, the school bus picked us up again and dropped us off at
the same place it picked us up in the morning and where it would pick us up
again the next day, which, after that amazing English lesson, we were really
excited for.
