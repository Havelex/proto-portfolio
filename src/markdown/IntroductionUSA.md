Greetings traveler!

We meet once again. As you can see, I have prepared a collection of scriptures
all about my travels to the United States of America.

**USA**. The land of the free. With most inmates per capita, but we don't
mention that. This was not the first time I had journeyed there, henceforth, I
was not expecting any surprises. However, besides Florida, I had only traveled
to the West Coast so far, plus Hawaii. It was therefore my first time to the
East Coast. (We do not count Florida, as it is incomparable to anything, but
Ohio.)

Now, it is very different to what I was used to in the USA, but to be fair, the
first few days I felt more like a citizen, as I was attending school and spend
my time with my host family, rather than in a hotel or doing sightseeing. Of
course, we also went to a few places of interest, however, most of the other
visitors were locals, too.  
Yet, most of the second week, we spend doing sightseeing with the class, and
there I really felt like a tourist, but I enjoyed the freedom our teachers
granted us. The same goes for our time in New York, but more to that later.

Personally, I liked Virginia the best, from all my visits to the USA. It is very
peaceful and friendly. Furthermore, attending high school was one of the best
parts of the whole trip and my peers surely agree with me.

Enough spoilers. Begone now and explore all my scriptures about the USA. Indulge
in my knowledge and learn from my experiences.  
\*\*And beware the Qu!
