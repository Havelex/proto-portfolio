#### Thanks

First, I want to start of by thanking my teacher Ms. Walzl, who has accompanied me through all those
years, not only helping me improve my English, but also in so many other parts of my academic
career. Additionally, I really feel obligated to address, how much she cares about her pupils, as
for example she has gone over and under to organize our trip to America, which I am absolutely sure
will have a very positive impact on mine and the others' English skills.  
Furthermore, a quick shout out to Ms. Neumeister, who has been exceptional since day one and is
absolutely great to work with, and despite only teaching us for just barely over half a year now, I
have already taken notice of my English improving through her efforts. Her class is very
educational, and she should be proud of herself and her effectiveness at such a young age. _(Except
for that one exercise in the first revision paper. That was just diabolical.)_.  
Last but not least, I have to thank Jakob for being such a motivating and great friend. Without him,
I would have not achieved what I did in all those years. Blud is a real one.

#### Speaking

Continuing with analyzing my progress, I will begin by evaluating my speaking skills. Yes, I
definitely still sometimes struggle with finding the right words and phrases during a conversation,
not because I don't know them, my vocabulary is very extensive. Nevertheless, my speaking has
definitely improved such that if I get into the situation where I cannot think of the word I am
looking for, I will try to keep the conversation going, instead of wasting time looking for the word
in my head. This has not only had positively affected my speaking during conversations, but also my
skills in presenting, in such a way that I come across much more confident.  
Speaking about presentations, I really enjoy in partaking in them, especially when I am presenting.
Although, you can really notice it, when the topic honestly piques my interest, because then I can
talk about it for hours, literally, without losing interest.  
Last but not least, I definitely have to say, that my pronunciation has improved gradually, and
there I have to give a little bit of credit to online games, since communication there is key and
fun, so consequently I participate in it.

#### Writing

Moreover, my writing has gotten better by a big chunk. Whilst I admit, that I do make more spelling
mistakes than I should, which I at least spellcheck, before finalizing anything, I do have to say
that the way I write, both in structure, creativity and vocabulary has expanded immensely. My final
act definitely has had its share on influence there, but I also believe that a lot of it comes from
movies, reading stories, playing games and other forms of creative media. Not social media though,
since it is, except for "Kurzgesagt" and other educational creators, in my opinion only good for
pure entertainment. Not that there is something wrong with that, but it did not really help improve
my writing.

#### Listening

However, it did have a positive influence on my listening and understanding and consequently also my
speaking. Definitely, because the most content creators that I watch on social media are native
speakers and therefore my understanding of the English language has risen drastically. Generally, I
have to say that my listening and comprehension can be safely categorized into native C2 level, as I
have never had a problem with not understanding anything since third grade.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, I would summarize my English in having improved enormously since I have started
high school. Of course, because the level of English there, with me attending a special English
class, being much higher than any I have ever experienced in my education before. Yet, I also
believe that it had something to do with me growing older and more mature, too. Henceforth, am
consuming more complex and mature content, ever since. And of course my amazing teachers have
contributed their fair share, too.  
To finalize, all the aforementioned factors have played a significant role in the never ending
evolution of my English, and I am determined to improve it until the end of time.
