Standing tall at 169 meters, it had been the tallest man-made structure ever,
until it was surpassed by the Eiffel Tower in 1889. The wonder in question is
the Washington Monument. A marble obelisk located in the middle of Washington
D.C. The project was so ambiguous at its time, that it had to be put on hold,
because of insufficient funding.

Even though it was just a very tall stone stick, the Washington Monument was one
of the most exciting sights, somehow. Probably, because it was so simple, yet so
beautiful and imposing.

Anyway, Washington D.C. offers many interesting and impressive sights, such as
the Martin Luther King Memorial, the Korean and Vietnam War Memorial and of
course the Lincoln Memorial. Standing before the Lincoln Memorial makes you feel
as if you were in Greece, as its architecture was heavily inspired by their
ancient temples. However, when turning 180 degrees, you were directly looking at
the Washington Monument. Despite it being far away, it was still enormous.

When finally arriving at the Washington Memorial, it was even more imposing than
expected. One fact you might learn there is that the whole monument is held
together by nothing but gravity and friction, as no mortar was being used in its
construction. Can you imagine that? It might remind one of the pyramids, since
they are another example of intelligent engineering (without the use of mortar).

Furthermore, its construction was started after the American, but then put on
hold during the civil war. Additionally, they once ran out of funding.
Nevertheless, the Washington Monument held up against all these crises and was
finished in 1884.

Its primitivity and simplicity is what makes the Washington Monument distinct
from all the other monuments. Not only does it bear a unique style, but it also
is proof of strength, survival and unity, as its construction lived through the
toughness of the civil war. With this, and of course, its potential for posing
and taking pictures, it proves, that sometimes it's all about perspective.
