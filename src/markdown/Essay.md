This essay's purpose is to discuss the importance of museums and public gardens, and argue which one
is more important over the other and shall therefore receive financial aid from the authorities.
Undoubtably, both facilities are objectively irreplaceable, nevertheless, people are in disagreement
which one is more valuable to society over the other. However, this essay will give logical reasons,
on why public gardens need funding from the authorities more, rather than museums.

Firstly, museums almost always receive private funding from investors and institutes.  
Parks, on the other hand, almost always relay solely on money from officials. Furthermore, museums
have a chance to generate revenue and with it profit, so they have the possibility to fund
themselves. In contrast, public parks are, as the name indicates, public and therefore have little
to no opportunity to charge people anything for simply visiting.

Secondly, population is constantly increasing.  
Consequently, the need for rising is rising, too. Surely, it is harder to strip a museum of all of
its contents and renovate the interior layout to make it suitable for living, than to flatten a park
in order to generate estates that are suitable for building houses designed for living in the first
place. Henceforth, public parks rely on financial aid more to ensure preservation, than museums do.

In conclusion, it can be logically argued, that parks are in need of official funding, in order to
survive.  
Finally, this leads to the argument, that the financial support reserved for public facilities
should be invested into public parks.
