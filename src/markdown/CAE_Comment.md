The results are slightly better than I expected, but the mistakes I made were predictable. The thing
is, when working through such an exam, you never catch all of your errors, no matter how precisely
you check. Nevertheless, I will say, that I have strongly improved my listenings and my use of
English had definitely seen worse days.  
However, some of my mistakes are still occurring consistently, with my favorite being me confidently
using the wrong prefix for words. My strategy is therefore to either refrain from using prefixes, by
adding words to my vocabulary that have the desired meaning per default, therefore my range of words
increases, too. It's a win-win.  
Unfortunately, in the case of use of English, you are not allowed to go too far off the original
word given, so you must use prefixes. In that case, my tactic remains focused studying of word
transformation, and when examining the results, it seems to be working.
