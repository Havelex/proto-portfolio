You were sent on a mission to explore a possibly inhabitable planet named **'Nirana'** far, far away,
so they put you into artificial hibernation in order to survive the long trip in your
antimatter-powered ship equipped with a warp engine. The journey would take 420 years and 69 days
one way, and you would be woken up, once you reached your destination. And sure enough, after a long
time, **"EQICA"** (Enhanced Quantum Intelligent Computing Artifact), your board computer wakes you
up.

"Ah!", she exclaims. "You are finally awake!" "It is 08:56 UTC and probably a lovely day on earth,
although I would advise against a space walk.", she appends whilst opening the ships shutters
revealing what seems to be a supermassive black hole right outside your window. "Apparently, the
ship had been grazed by a gamma-ray burst and as a result lost all of its power. It then engaged the
emergency auxiliary power.", she explains. "However, this was just barely enough to keep you in
hibernation. Consequently, the ship has been drifting through space uncontrollably ever since."

"Currently, we are drifting towards the supermassive black hole, that bares the name
**'Gayatt'**. Unfortunately, my efforts to get the ship up and running again have failed, since
almost all tasks require human interaction. Luckily, you are human enough, and you are awake."
**EQICA** explains herself: "My apologies captain, I would have woken you up long ago, but the
radiation from the gamma-ray burst had resulted in serious damage to your body and the only way for
you to survive was to keep you in hibernation and heal you over long time. Nevertheless, the healing
procedure might have resulted in some side effects which may include impotence, blindness and
amnesia. However, there should be no cancer left inside you, so there is that."

"In conclusion, the whole incident has
left us immobilized and drifting towards impending doom.", she explains. "According to my
calculation, this leaves us with 3 days to get the power back on, repair the engine and navigational
system and get the power back up and running, before crossing the event horizon after which there is
no return."

"Now, there is no more time to lose. You should start by reading the first entry of the **Super
Emergency Protocol**
_'[SEP_0000](/explore/sections/Final%20Act/posts/SEP_0000)'_. It will explain how
to proceed further", **EQICA** tells you. "Oh and before I forget it, remember to utilize the search
function of your handbook to quickly navigate between protocol entries."

"Alas, I wish you good probabilities Captain!"
