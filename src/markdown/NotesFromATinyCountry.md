Or short **"HTL"** is one of many different forms of high school in Austria. For context, Austria
is one if not the only country with specialized schools before college or university. There are
normal schools where you learn normal school things, like math, science, English and so on and then
there are these special schools where you learn the same things plus some additional ones, too. For
example in an **"HWL"** the students have to learn math like anyone else, and then they have to
further learn more boring math. Or in "HAK" they are being taught on how to properly sell stuff,
which if you think about it doesn't even sound that bad.

But then there is the **"HTL"** which specializes in technological crafts such as informatics,
engineering, building machines, building robots, building machines that build robots and so on.
At first, that sounds very promising, considering that we live in the age of digital advancement,
but when you investigate one of those so-called _"schools"_ you quickly realize, that is looks
better from the outside than it actually is on the inside. Although, not even that is often true as
most of the time the buildings either look like a prison, a psych ward or are just a big cube.
Unsurprisingly, it does not get better when you enter.

The inside does not really encourage happy feelings and shares more of a resemblance with something
from the movie **"1984"** than a place where children are meant to prosper.
Also, never enter the men's restrooms without a hazmat suit that protects both from poisonous fumes
and radiation. Furthermore, there are rarely any investments made to upgrade any equipment, so that
if you brought your grandma with you inside an **"HTL"** even she would be able to operate the
computers there.

Regarding the entities that roam inside an **"HTL"**, there are three different kinds: Students,
teachers and elderly people, who teach the technical subjects, such as programming.
The students are harmless really, since they suffer from sever mental health issues, probably
induced by the school itself. Nevertheless, some students have adapted to survive in these
circumstances and some even manage to crack a smile once or twice a day.  
The teachers are the only normal and frankly working part of the school. Why is that so? Because,
they have studied not only the subjects they teach, but also how to teach them. In contrast, the
elders, who technically are teachers, did not study how to teach what they teach. They are people
who have worked in the industry, grew tired of it and decided to retire early by becoming teachers
to give their knowledge to the next generation and gain about three months of paid vacation.  
What a life.

Unfortunately, as aforementioned, they did not properly study the ways of teaching or even want to
really teach, which means that most of the time a handful of students teach themselves what the
ancient ones should have taught them, so that they can in turn teach it to the rest of the class.
Students give up their precious leisure time to teach what the teachers should have taught, teachers
don't have to do anything, everyone is happy.

However, I want to make clear, that a lot of the elderly teachers try really hard to teach and even
give up their own free time to study new technologies they can teach their pupils.
