**Harmony** means balance. To be in agreement and rid of conflict, and it starts within oneself. If
one is in accord with themselves, harmony may prosper. Henceforth, finding inner peace is the first
step in bringing true peace anywhere else. If discord reigns inside, it will reflect on the outside
and harmony may not flourish. Confidence is important to achieve inner peace. Therefore, one must
understand themselves in order to reach their full potential. One must nurture themselves, care
about themselves, believe in themselves.  
However, harmony does not souly come from within, since if others believe in one and one believes in
others, then not only will the confidence and inner peace within those who are involved be
strengthened, but also will harmony be allowed to harmonize amongst everyone else.  
Harmony also means not to live in the past, but to learn from it. The past can hurt a lot, it makes
no sense to live in it then, right? Neither should one look too far into the future, or they might
not see where they step. If one is too concerned with what was and what will be, they forget what
is. In order to achieve inner peace and harmony, one must let go of the illusion of control.  
There is a saying.

_**"Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why it is called the
present!"**_
