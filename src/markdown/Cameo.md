# Alas, ... Peace

You try to concentrate, as your eyes are adjusting to the rapid change of brightness one last time.
When taking a closer look around yourself, you realize, that you are standing on a hill, which
provides a spectacular view over the _new world_ the orb has dropped you off. When you were using
the orb, you were thinking about a peaceful land, far from any conflict that could disturb your
life. However, not only does the land you have been transported to seem harmonious, it also appears
to be empty, as you can see far into the horizon and watch over the whole valley from your position,
but seem to be unable to spot any signs of civilization or humans at all. The only life you observe
are the birds in the sky and herds of horses, gangs of elks and other groups of game, that are
unfamiliar to you.

Eventually, after you have finished admiring this seemingly perfect domain you notice a forest not
far from you. As you approach you notice the sound of a stream, and surely after taking a few steps
deeper into the woods, you see a rivulet transporting the clearest water that you have ever seen in
your long life. As you are following the flow downwards, soon the rivulet turns into a creek of
crystal clear water. Hesitantly, after submerging your hand in the water, you decide to finally
kneel down and take a giant sip of the water, as it has been a long time, since you have had any
water. Not only does it taste amazingly refreshing, but it also feels as if you had just drank pure
life.

Ultimately, you decide to get up, and you look into the sky, which is when you notice that dusk has
fallen and so you decide to set up camp for the night. You make your way back to the hill outside
the forest and with a single hand gesture you conjure a comfortable looking tent in front of you.
As you get ready for bed, you think about your future and come to the conclusion, that sooner or
later you would have to construct some sort permanent residence. Henceforth, as you lay down, you
set your sights on tomorrow to build a log cabin for you to live in and enjoy your new life of
peace.

As dawn breaks, you start your project and begin lumbering logs for your abode. Fortunately, you can
still rely on your magic to make work easier for you, and so as dawn broke once again, you hammer in
the last nail and take a few steps back in order to proudly admire your work. Last but not least,
you conjure a rocking chair onto the veranda of your new home and completely exhausted, you sit down
and glaze over the valley in front of you. To finalize the beginning of your new life you replace
your wizard hat with a more humble one, to symbolize that you are starting not a new chapter but a
whole new book. You think about what you are going to do with your time now, except for enjoying
this world of course. Maybe, will write scrolls about your times when you were a traveler once.

Finally, you let a restful whisper leave your bodey:

_"Alas, ... peace."_
