I found reading those short stories or anecdotes quite enjoyable, as that I would read them
_voluntarily_ in my free time, not because a had to, but because I wanted to.
To be fair, one of the reasons for this might be, that I have had already read the book in the past,
prior to the assignment.  
This was however not the case with **"Notes From A Big Country"**, by Bill Bryson, who is by the way
an excellent column writer and author. Of course there were some passages or even whole chapters,
that were not exactly my taste, but the good thing is that every chapter is different and whilst I
don't remember all the chapters I've read, I do remember, that from the seven chapters I have had to
read for school, I disliked only one of them, which I would consider a reasonably good quote.

The mini-presentations everyone had to hold additionally were partially interesting and entertaining
to listen to, especially as they strongly reflected the presenters taste in books and texts. Of
course, I had to hold one of them mini-presentations myself, too, which I really enjoyed to give. To
give you an idea of how much I liked presenting this one, I talked so much and for so long, that I
had to be stopped halfway through and continue the _next_ English lesson.  
Nevertheless, I found the assignment overall very enjoyable.
